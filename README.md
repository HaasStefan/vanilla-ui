## Philosophy

- framework-agnostic
- own your design system
- customize everything

Design systems and component libraries are being reinvented in every framework. Angular, React, Vue, Svelte... All of them have their own implementation of a button, table, date picker, etc., even though these components are doing the same thing in a different syntax.

Vanilla UI is based on web components, which are natively supported by all modern browsers. This means that you can use Vanilla UI in any framework or even without a framework. By building on top of Vanilla UI, you can create a design system that is truly framework agnostic and can be used in any project.
